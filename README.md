### Coding Challenge Guidelines
In the movies.json file you will find a list of 70 movies and the "movie preference" of about 800 users.  We would like you to create a application that takes as input a number of movie ID's and this data file. The application should then calculate and output a list of movie recommendations based on this list and the data file. Think about it as an Amazon.com suggestion: "the user says he likes movies A, B, C on this list, what other movies from the list would you recommend based on the other user data". 

Some points to pay attention to: 
- Think about testing, documentation, packaging, readability
- Make sure that the requirements to run the application can be easily run. 
- There is no "perfect" solution for this problem and there are many ways to try to solve it. Don't try to guess what we think is a good solution.
